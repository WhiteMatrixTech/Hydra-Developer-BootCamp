Project Intro:
Project Goal
To build a donation platform to contribute to any type of fund raising such as saving species in danger, helping mitigate climate change, helping refugees around the globe, etc.

Solution using blockchain
Crystal clear transparency on fund utilization.
Fair governance/decision making based on DAO
Proof of donation with leveraging NFTs (preferably tax deductive in the future)
Reduce the middle person and indirect cost

Process flow 
An organisation who needs fund visits our platform. We don’t charge them.
Collect donation via cryptos.
Donors votes on the usage, vesting period of the fund, etc. via our platform token.
Donors get NFT for the proof of donation.
The organisation start receiving fund based on the determined vesting period. They have to report back on the usage of funds to the platform for the traceability purpose, by following the decision of usage. Otherwise, they don’t get the rest of funds. Also, the platform will charge small amount of operation fees from the fund.
Donors can trace how their funds are being used.
