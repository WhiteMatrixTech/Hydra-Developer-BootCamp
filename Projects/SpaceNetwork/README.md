Project Intro: SpaceNetwork is a generic message passing protocol that connects to multiple chains including Ethereum, Solana, Conflux eSpace, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Avalanche.

SpaceNetwork does this through emitting messages from one chain which are observed by a Guardian network of nodes and verified. After verification, this message is submitted to the target chain for processing.
